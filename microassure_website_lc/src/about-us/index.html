    <h2>How is MicroUmbrella different from traditional insurers?</h2>

    <p>Traditional insurer makes a profit when a claim is being rejected. This means, the more claims they rejected, the more profits they make, and the losing end is the customers. According to independant reports in many countries, more than 40% insurance consumers gave feedbacks that getting their claim money is slow and claim procedure is troublesome.</p>

    <p>MicroUmbrella was built differently. We take a fixed fee out of the premium, the rest goes to paying insurance coverage. Unlike traditional insurers, we're not in conflict with our customers, hence, we're happy to assist our customers to obtain claims fast, without any fuss or hassle. </p>
